# NumPy
- A popular library for Data science and ML and it is very similar to Python list

## Reason to use NumPy
- Python list is slower and NumPy is written in C and it is super fast 
- GPA is a lot in ML becuase we need to do a lot of computation 
- NumPy is every easy for computer understand 
- NumPy = numerical Python
- Vectorization via broadcasting (avoiding loops when you are wiriting calcualtion, such a calculation a list in Python)
- Backbone of other Python scientific packages 

## What is NunPy
