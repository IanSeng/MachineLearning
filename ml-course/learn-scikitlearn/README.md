# Scikitlearn (sklearn)
A python machine learnin library that helps us to build a model that patter the data and make prediction. 

## Why Scikit-Learn ?
- Built on NumPy and Matplotlib 
- Has many built in machine learning models 
- Methods to evaluate your ML nodels 
- Very well designed API 

## Scikit-learn workflow
1. Get data ready 
2. Pick a model (to suit your problem)
3. Fit the model to the data and make a prediction 
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve through experimentation 
6. Save and reload your trained model
